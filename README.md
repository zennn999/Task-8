# Task-8

1.Choose a reputable free VPN service and sign up.
2.Download and install the VPN client.
3.Connect to a VPN server (choose closest or any location).
4.Verify your IP address has changed (use whatismyipaddress.com).
5.Browse a website to confirm traffic is encrypted.
6.Disconnect VPN and compare browsing speed and IP.
7.Research VPN encryption and privacy features.
8.Write a summary on VPN benefits and limitations.




1. For the VPN I chose proton vpn as it is free and available on Windows.
 
2. Downloaded and setup the vpn application.
 
3. Connected to a server in Netherlands.
 
4. IP address has indeed changed to the new address.
 
5. The lock icon on the browser address bar tells us that the trafffic is encrypted.
 
6. After disconnecting the VPN the browsing speeds increased and IP address has now returned to original.
 
7. While using a VPN I looked into how it actually protects your data. Most reliable VPNs use strong encryption usually something called AES-256 which is the same level of security used by banks and the military. This makes it extremely hard for anyone like hackers or even your internet provider to read what you're doing online. I also found that VPN's use different protocols to manage how data is sent. Two common ones are OpenVPN and WireGuard. OpenVPN is older but well-tested, while WireGuard is faster and more modern. Some VPNs even offer things like multi-hop which routes your connection through two VPN servers instead of one for extra privacy.


8.After using a VPN and doing some research, I’ve got a better understanding of how it helps

Benefits:

A VPN hides your real IP address, making it harder for websites or hackers to track your location.
It encrypts your internet traffic, which is especially useful on public Wi-Fi (like in cafes or airports), where your data could otherwise be exposed.
You can access content that’s restricted in your region, like websites or streaming platforms that are only available in certain countries.
In places with censorship, a VPN can help bypass blocks and let you browse freely.

Limitations:

Free VPNs usually have slower speeds, limited servers, or data caps.
Some free services might track your activity or show ads to make money.
VPNs can’t protect you from everything — for example, if you log into a scam website or download malware, you’re still at risk.
Not all VPNs work with streaming services like Netflix, especially on free plans.
Sometimes, websites may block VPN traffic, so you might run into access issues.
